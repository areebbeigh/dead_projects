## What's this?

This is a list of projects that I've killed off.

## Why kill projects?

- Shortage of time
- A lot of the stuff I've written was mostly for practice
- Making time to focus on some of the more awesome stuff (^_^)/

Also, TBH at the point of writing this I feel that many of my current projects are of poor quality and there's a long way I've got to go. So, I feel the need to get some stuff out of the way.

## On Hiatus
Projects on pause mode. (Lol, I might not even come back to these). Or maybe I'm (planning on) rewriting these because of the horrible code I'd written before.

## Dead
Projects (if you can even call them that) that are mostly roughly written and are of no real use. I was an over excited newbie with 0 experience, what do you expect?
